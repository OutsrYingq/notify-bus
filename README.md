> ⚠️ **notify-bus is in early development.** The scaffold is up; the core pipeline is being built milestone by milestone. Star to follow, or jump into [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) / [Discussions](https://github.com/lorelum/notify-bus/discussions).

## The problem

Your team lives in GitHub and chats in Feishu / Lark. Every push, PR, issue, release, star, fork — you want a timely heads-up in the group chat. The existing options are either a rigid GitHub Action, a pure CLI, or a SaaS that doesn't let you own your data or your routing rules. None of them give you a **configurable pipeline** *and* a **visual admin UI** in one self-hosted box.

## How notify-bus does it

```
[GitHub] ──webhook──▶ [Bun + Elysia server]
                          │
                          ▼
                    [Pipeline: Filter → Enricher → Template → ...]
                          │
                          ▼
                    [Dispatcher] ──route match──▶ [Channel Adapter] ──▶ [Feishu / Lark API]
                                                    ▲
                                                    │  ChannelAdapter interface
                                                    │  (Feishu today; Slack / DingTalk / WeCom / Discord next)
```

- **Webhook in, notifications out.** Verify GitHub's HMAC-SHA256 signature against the raw body, match the event against your routes, render the configured template, and dispatch it to the channel's adapter. *(The configurable middleware pipeline — Filter / Enricher / Template — is the M2 milestone and is not built yet.)*
- **Multi-channel by design, not by accident.** A `ChannelAdapter` interface is the only thing a new channel needs to implement. Feishu is the first adapter; the routing and config layer is channel-agnostic.
- **Configure without redeploying.** A built-in admin UI (React + Vite + Tailwind) edits routes, channels, and templates against a REST API — backed by `bun:sqlite`. No YAML round-trips to adjust a rule.
- **One image, one process.** Ships as a single Bun process that serves the API *and* the built frontend. One Docker container, one volume for data. The repo is a Bun workspace monorepo (`packages/server` + `packages/web`) that builds into that one image.

## 5-minute tour

*(The steps below work today: GitHub webhooks in, Feishu cards out. The configurable middleware pipeline is M2 and not built yet.)*

```bash
# Run locally
bun install                # installs all workspace packages
cp .env.example .env       # set GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET
bun run dev                # server on :3000, frontend on :5173 (Vite proxy)

# Or, self-host with Docker
docker compose up -d       # serves API + built frontend on :3000
```

Then point a GitHub webhook at `https://your-host/webhook`, add a Feishu custom-bot webhook as a channel in the admin UI, and add a route. Done.

## How it's different

| | GitHub Action / raw webhook | SaaS notifier | **notify-bus** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Self-hosted / own your data** | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Configurable pipeline** | ❌ (recode to change) | partial | ✅ Filter / Enricher / Template |
| **Visual admin UI** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Multi-channel** | manual per channel | per-plan limits | ✅ `ChannelAdapter` interface |
| **Templates per event** | hardcoded | limited | ✅ Handlebars, per event type |
| **License** | varies | proprietary | ✅ MIT |

```

Two config sources, merged at runtime:
- **YAML** (`config.yaml`) — seed/bootstrap config, human-edited, supports hot reload.
- **SQLite** (`data.db`) — the source of truth for routes, channels, templates, logs; edited via the admin UI / REST API.

## Roadmap

Built in the open, milestone by milestone. Each milestone is one issue + one PR.

- **M1** — Core webhook ingestion + GitHub signature verification + Feishu adapter (with signing) + fallback route. YAML-only, no frontend.
- **M2** — Middleware pipeline: Filter, Enricher, Template (Handlebars). Order + enable/disable configurable.
- **M3** — `bun:sqlite` persistence (routes/channels/templates/logs) + REST API (CRUD) + Config Manager (YAML↔DB merge, hot reload).
- **M4** — Frontend skeleton + Routes management page (Eden treaty wired up).
- **M5** — Channels management (with connection test) + Template editor (Monaco + live preview).
- **M6** — Logs page + test-send (`POST /api/test`).
- **M7** — Integration tests, docs polish, Docker image hardening, tag `v0.1`.

## Project status

🟡 **Early development.** The M1 chain works end to end — GitHub webhooks in, Feishu cards out. The configurable middleware pipeline (M2) is not built yet. This is the right moment to shape the direction — join [Discussions](https://github.com/lorelum/notify-bus/discussions).
