 * carried on `EventMessage.metadata`, so they cannot disagree about who was
 * addressed.

 * Logins map to Feishu `user_id`s by hand in the channel config — the id type a
 * spike in a real group verified (`<at id=<user_id>>` in a schema 2.0 card,
 * `code: 0`, client notification received). No contacts API, no OAuth, no
