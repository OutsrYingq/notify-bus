/**
 * GitHub webhook signature verification.
 *
 * SECURITY-CRITICAL (see AGENTS.md). The rules:
 *
 *   1. The signature is HMAC-SHA256 over the *raw request body bytes* — NOT
 *      the JSON-parsed-then-restringified body. Re-serializing changes byte
 *      ordering/whitespace and breaks verification. The raw buffer is
 *      captured in `routes/webhook.ts` BEFORE Elysia's body parser runs
 *      (via the `onParse` lifecycle hook).
 *   2. Compare against the `X-Hub-Signature-256` header, formatted as
 *      `sha256=<lowercase hex>`.
 *   3. Use constant-time comparison (`timingSafeEqual`) to prevent timing
 *      attacks.
 *   4. The secret comes from `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` env var — never the DB
 *      or config file.
 *
 * Reference: https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/using-webhooks/validating-webhook-deliveries
